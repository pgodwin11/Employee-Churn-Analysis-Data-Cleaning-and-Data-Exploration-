Business Request

I was assigned the task of organizing and refining data for Dunder Miflin Paper Company, based out of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Scranton branch had brought up a notable issue of employee churn. Concerned about the high turnover rate among employees, the regional manager, Michael Scott, was eager to understand the factors contributing to churn.  By gaining insights into these factors, and looking at the results of other branches, the company aims to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.

Conclusion

Procurement department had the highest average churn rate likeness at 66.2%, while Administration had the least with 48.3%.
Salary is not significantly impacting job satisfaction. "Satisfied" and "Very satisfied" individuals ranked 2nd and 3rd in job satisfaction percentages, despite ranking 3rd and 4th in average salary.
Work-life balance ratings with "good" and "excellent" with an average tenure of almost 8 years, with fair ratings with about 7 years, suggesting a subtle impact on tenure.
Legal had the 2nd highest churn rate and ranked 13th in average tenure, while IT support ranked 10th in churn rate but 1st in average tenure, showcasing a signifcant correlation between churn rate and tenure across departments.
Chicago, Atlanta, and Denver, despite ranking 6th, 7th, and 8th in average salary, were the top 3 branches in terms of average tenure. This suggest factors other than salary influence employee retention, possibly job market competition and cost of living.
Despite Denver ranking highest in "Very Dissatisfied" and second in "Dissatisfied" categories, it ranks second in average tenure. This suggests that factors other than environmental satisfaction, such as work-life balance, flexibility or compensation, may contribute to Denver's longer average tenure compared to other branches.
